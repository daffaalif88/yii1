			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<p>
				I am an individual full of enthusiasm for the world of Front End development.
				With an educational background in Information Systems, I have developed a
				strong interest and skill in designing and implementing engaging and
				responsive user interfaces. My expertise includes using Figma as a key tool in
				crafting designs and prototypes that visualize ideas into compelling user
				experiences. I believe that design is not just about aesthetics, but also about
				functionality and interactivity. Through my journey as a Front End Developer,
				I aim to continue to explore innovation and build satisfying and engaging digital
				experiences for users.
